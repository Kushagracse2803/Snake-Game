'''In this code block:

The while game_is_on: loop runs the game continuously as long as game_is_on is True.
Screen.update() refreshes the screen with each iteration, and time.sleep(0.1) pauses the loop briefly to slow down the snakeâ€™s movement.
The for loop (for seg_num in range(len(segments)-1, 0, -1):) moves each segment of the snake starting from the tail (last segment) to follow the segment ahead of it.
For each segment seg_num, the coordinates (xcor, ycor) of the segment just before it (seg_num-1) are retrieved and assigned to the current segment (seg_num), making it move to the previous segment's position.
The first segment (segments[0], the snake's head) moves forward by 20 units, making the snake appear to slither.
This replicates the snake's movement by shifting all segments forward in sequence.'''
# while game_is_on:
#     Screen.update()  
#     time.sleep(0.1)
#     # for seg_num in range(start=2,stop=0,step=-1):#moving snake from block 2 to 1 the 1 to 0
    # for seg_num in range(len(segments)-1,0,-1):
    #   new_x=segments[seg_num-1].xcor()
    #   new_y=segments[seg_num-1].ycor()
    #   segments[seg_num].goto(new_x,new_y)
    # segments[0].forward(20)

'''new_x=segments[seg_num-1].xcor():

This line gets the x-coordinate (xcor()) of the segment immediately in front of the current segment (segments[seg_num-1]).
segments is likely a list (or an array) of objects representing the body parts of the snake, where each part (segment) has a position (xcor() returns the x-coordinate of that position).
seg_num is the index of the current segment being processed in the loop. By subtracting 1, you're referencing the segment directly in front of the current one.
new_y=segments[seg_num-1].ycor():

This line is similar to the first, but it gets the y-coordinate (ycor()) of the segment directly in front of the current one.
segments[seg_num].goto(new_x,new_y):

This line moves the current segment (segments[seg_num]) to the position (new_x, new_y) obtained from the segment ahead of it.
goto() is likely a method that updates the position of an object by moving it to the specified coordinates.'''
